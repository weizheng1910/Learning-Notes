--Terminal Commands ---- 

$ pwd stands for print working directory. It shows where you are currently "located" in the file system. 
$ ls shows the contents of the directory you are currently in. 
$ cd means to change directory, equivalent to double clicking.
$ cd .. means to go back where you came from, or to go back to your parent directory.

**To enter a file name with space use the '\' at the end of the first word of the file name. 
For example: 
test\ folder

Many commands consist of 3 parts: the command, followed by flags(or options), and finally arguments.

For example: 

$ ls -a 

This command lists all files whose names begin with a ( in a given directory).

$cd Downloads

This command change the directory to the "Downloads" folder.

$ find . -name <insert name here> 	 This will help you find the file in the directory you are in. 

Eg.

$ find . -name carmen_sandiego.png

------------------------------------------

$ cd ~ 

"~" means home directory. cd ~ refer you to your home directory.

$ touch joke.txt

Creates a file called "joke.txt". If we "touch" a file that already exists, it will not be overwritten. 

$ start joke.txt

Opens the file joke.txt
 
$ mkdir funny_things

Creates a directory(folder) called funny_things. 

$ mv joke.txt funny_things/

Moves the file joke.txt into funny_things folder. The / in funny_things/ specify that it is a directory and not a file. Without it, you would rename joe.txt as a new file, funny_things. 
** 
mv <filename1> to <filename2> would mean moving the contents in filename1 into filename2,
Meaning after the operation, you will have a file with named <filename2> with filename2's content inside.

$ cp joke.txt joke2.txt

-Duplicates the file joke.txt and names it joke2.txt . If the second argument is a directory, the specified file is copied into the directory.
-Similar to mv, but original file is not removed.

$ rm joke2.txt 

Permanently remove the files. 

$ cp -r jokes copy_of_jokes

Makes a copy of jokes, and anything within the directory (-r means to recursively copy anything within the directory), and name it copy_of_jokes

$ rm -r copy_of_jokes 

$ cp -r World/ ~

Copying the World/ directory from the Downloads folder to the Home directory.

Use '-r' if you want to copy, move or remove a folder with contents within it.
