## Systems Design

### Protocols

A network protocol dictates how computers and servers communicate over a network.

#### IP
The fundamental layer of all network protocols is the Internet Protocol.
Messages over IP are transmitted in packets, which are small bits on information.
Packets contain:
* Headers, which states from and to whom the data is sent, identified by IP address
* Data itself
