Given this 

var employee = {
  name : "Chee Kean",
  wages : {
    scheduledWeeklyHours : 40,
    rate: 15
  },
  contact : {
    phone : "87665434",
    address : {
      street : "259 Cantonment",
      unit : "12-12",
      zipcode : "2345566"
    }
  }
};

Both ways of accessing phone numbers: 

employee["contact"]["phone"]
employee.contact.phone

Putting phone inside contact is more organised.

Eg. 2

var myShape = {
  height:2,
  width:6,
  depth:8
};


var calculateSurface = function(shape1, shape2){
  return (shape1.height + shape2.height) * ()
};

Can add in objects as parameter to show the relationship between shapes.

prompt and list objects. 

------

var i = 20;

while (i > 0) {

  console.log("i is " + i);
  i = i - 5;
}

CSS

Using display: inline-block

use inspect to see real-time changes.
inline-block -> allows blocks elements with specified height to stack left to right. 
span allows you to style things in the middle of a paragraph. 


INLINE ELEMENTS DOESNT HAVE A HEIGHT PROPERTY!!!!
INLINE ELEMENTS HAVE NO VERTICAL MARGINS, OR PROPERTIES.
WITH INLINE BLOCK IT IS POSSIBLE

Positioning:

fixed: relative to viewport.
absolute: relative to the page. 

Position an element within another element.
Set parent element position as relative. 

If you don't need absolute, you don't need relative.

Default position is just static.
