2. Cloning - making a local copy of the fork.
	-open terminal 
	-go to where you'd like to store repository
	-type $ git clone https://url-to-clone
	-the url is found by clicking the green button that says "Clone or Download"
	-for windows, ctrl + insrt to copy,shift + insrt to paste.
3. Edit - use Atom or Sublime to edit. 
4. Adding and Committing 
	- $ git add <your-file-name>
	- $ git commit -m "message"
5. Pushing 
	- Your local repo will have the updated changes but your remote repo does not. 
	- To update remote repo, you have to push those changes using git push origin master. 
	- "origin" is the shortcut for the url in your default remote repo. 
	- "master" refers to the branch on the remote repo where youare currently adding your changes.
