### Monolithic Vs Microservices

A microservices architecture is where there is an user interface through which API calls can be made to separate 'microservices'. Each microservice is an application on its own which can be deployed and developed independently from each other (as a result making it easier to modify and update) . HTTP REST is one of the many ways communication between microservices could be done.
