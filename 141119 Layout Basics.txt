**** Every HTML element on a webpage is in a box! ***********

Thus, every element has: 

-content
-padding : between the content and the box ( padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px (NESW)) 
-border : outside the padding but within the box (eg. border: 10px black solid;)
-margin : outside the box; clears an area around the border. By default, the elements are aligned to the topleft of the page. However, a box can be horizontally centered by setting right and left margins to auto. i.e. (margin: 0 auto;)
